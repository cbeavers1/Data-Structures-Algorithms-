 Data-Structures-Algorithms-

1.) What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Printing out a sample schedule by ordering a list of courses from input in alphanumeric order.

2.) How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I determined the run-time of multiple data structures and with the useful nature of binary search trees determined
that a bst would be the best for the job in this situation given the input. In other situations, possibly not. 

3.) How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I used previous work of mine, whether it be course work or old free-time work, for reference and ideas of how to structure the program.
For instance, in a previous course, one of my programs required a similar menu style and I used the layout as a guide for my new menu. This 
is a specific issue when the menu is in a function rather than directly to screen because of how input needs to be handled and other problems.

4.) How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I now understand how to create data structures in many different forms and how to navigate those structures using algorithms. 
While I knew of embedded data structures such as arrays or vectors, complex data structures are almost entrirely new to me. 

5.) How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Using data structures has opened my eyes to the reusablitly of code in many different situations and now I always think ahead about 
how my code might be reused in the future.
